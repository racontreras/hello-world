Hello, World out there!
I am taking a course on GIS and Python programming at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
This course is my first ever programming language course, so it is a challenging undertaking.
I hope to learn lots of new things about how to use the Python language to program typical
geoprocessing tasks with it.
Thanks!
